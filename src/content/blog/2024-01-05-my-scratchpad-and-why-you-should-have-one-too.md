[Here](https://github.com/krsche/scratchpad) you can find my scratchpad for programming and computer related stuff.

This is the place I go to for playing around with new things, testing stuff or for anything I feel like I need to have
a look at the basics again before continuing.

It's not more, just that. But trust me having a scratchpad is great.
So here is why you should have one too:

- I'm not creating random folders for tests all over my pc and instead keep these things organized too
- I keep whatever I wrote in a place where I can find it in the future
- There are no rules for quality here, but it being a repo filters out the absolute worst on commit-time
- I reduce the chances of loosing stuff _I know I did somewhere once_ and can search for it here
- I regularly use things I experimented with here as examples when teaching others during my day work

So, go and create your own scratchpad. You won't regret it!

```bash
gh repo create scratchpad -c -d "Where I mess up first" --disable-wiki --public 
```
